# Word Counter

A Chrome extension that counts the number of words in the page, _kinda_.

This is a demo built for the **Co-Code Crunch** study jam organized by GDSC Crimsons, GDSC PLM, and GDSC Yonsei. The slides are available in [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/arnellebalane/introduction-to-building-chrome-extensions).
